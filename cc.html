        <h3> <a href="cc.html"> Connecting to care </a></h3>
      <h4>I am sitting on my balcony. It is spring and there is a little bit of heat in the sun. The balcony looks out over a road. The road is usually busy… an endless stream of trucks and cars but right now there is no traffic. Everyone is self-isolating. The machine has stopped. It feels…
        Peaceful. I can hear different birds… the wren, the blackbird, the robin. A blue tit is flitting from one branch to the next. Life goes on. I could sit here all day.

       <p> “Don’t try”. Those are the two simple words of advice offered by the poet Charles Bukowski.
        
        It jars for most people to receive that advice… especially those of us who want a better world.
        
        I have been stuck in a cycle of “trying” for a while now and I see a lot of it in the world
        
        Trying and searching and wanting.</p>
        
        Everywhere I look people, including me, are rushing to the next moment.
        
        I know that 99% of people probably won’t resonate with what I’m going to say. They might think that I’m an idiot and that this piece is a cop out.
        
        Not trying is seen as the “worst”.<br>
        
        It means that you are lazy and you don’t care.
        
        It means that you settle.<br>
        
        It means that you do nothing.
        
        It means that you are part of the problem.<br>
        
        It means that you are helpless.<br>
        
        Is that really true?<br>
        
        I don’t think so.<br>
        
        Does the oak tree try?<br>
        
        No. It just is.<br>
        
        Does the oak tree do nothing?<br>
        
        No. It just is.<br>
        
        .
        
        .
        
        .
        
        I just sat with it and here’s what I feel.<br>
        
        Maybe you feel differently and that’s ok.<br>
        
        
        More impact.<br>
        
        More acknowledgement.<br>
        
        More people agreeing with me.<br>
        
        More people telling me I’m great.<br>
        
        More distraction.<br>
        
        More security
        
        Just take a breath.</div>
